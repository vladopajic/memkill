# MemKill

Kills any process that exceeds specified memory.

## Why?

MemKill is a useful tool for managing processes with memory leak issues. It helps maintain system stability by monitoring memory usage and terminating processes that exceed a specified memory threshold. This proactive approach prevents the operating system from crashing or freezing due to excessive memory consumption.

## Usage

```
memkill 10 // kill any process which memory usage exceeds 10MB
```
